# This is an autofilling form Chrome extension.

 It copies the form data you previously provided and pastes all the data in the second place where you want to paste it. The data is pasted according to the form labels. I created this extension using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to capture the data from the form labels, while Python is used to create a clipboard where the form data is first stored. When I click the paste button, all the data is pasted into the second form.
